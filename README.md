An Upgraded Pokémon Info Retrieval Script

Description:

This Python script allows users to retrieve specific information about a Pokémon using the PokéAPI. Users can enter a Pokémon's name and specify what details they want to learn about, such as abilities, stats, or types.


How It Works:

The script prompts the user to enter a Pokémon's name.

The user is then asked what information they want to retrieve.

The script fetches data from the PokéAPI and prints the requested details.

If the user enters an invalid Pokémon name, an error message is displayed.

If the requested information is not found, an appropriate message is shown.
